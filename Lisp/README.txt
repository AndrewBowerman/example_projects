Learning Lisp

This collection of LISP programs showcases the basic syntax
and structure of LISP data and control structures. Run these
programs on the command line by calling:

clisp filename.lisp

Or by pointing to your lisp install directly, e.g. on Tesla:

/usr/local/stow/clisp-2.49/clisp filename.lisp

A summary of the 5 programs included:
array.lisp
    Our hero, Conan of Cimmeria, spots a caravan.
    The program selects 3 random wagons from the
    wagon array for Conan to attack.
decisions.lisp
    Conan measures the amount of magic in the air
    and determines how close he is to the wizard.
function.lisp
    Here, Conan's magic sniffer is in a function
    so that he can continue searching for his foe.
list.lisp
    Conan takes the CDR of the caravan several times 
    to select a very valuable wagon.
loop.lisp
    Conan grabs the wizard and uses a loop to 
    assault his enemy.
